abstract = {Emotional experience and regulation emerge from coordinated activity across large‑scale brain networks, including the default mode network (DMN). This review synthesizes evidence for the crucial roles of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key DMN hub, in emotional processing and regulation. We first embed the classic ventral‑positive/dorsal‑negative mPFC distinction within a DMN functional gradient framework, demonstrating that during emotional experience dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) and ventral mPFC (vmPFC) shift toward opposite ends of the DMN gradient, consistent with functional differentiation. We next reconceptualize emotion regulation along a control‑demand axis: dmPFC, in concert with frontoparietal control regions, engages during effortful reappraisal, whereas vmPFC supports automatic, low-effort processes such as extinction or placebo effects. With practice, regulation shifts toward progressively more automatic vmPFC‑based processes. We integrate vmPFC’s modality‑general affect coding with self‑referential appraisal and a low‑dimensional, grid‑structured affective map that links valuation to subjective experience. Finally, we outline future directions to probe dynamic DMN contributions to emotional processes. This perspective clarifies DMN contributions to emotional processes through distinct but complementary processes and can inform research and interventions in emotional disorders.}

abstract = {A baseline or control state is fundamental to the understanding of
 most complex systems. Defining a baseline state in the human brain,
 arguably our most complex system, poses a particular challenge. Many
 suspect that left unconstrained, its activity will vary unpredictably.
 Despite this prediction we identify a baseline state of the normal
 adult human brain in terms of the brain oxygen extraction fraction or
 OEF. The OEF is defined as the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to
 oxygen delivered by flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the
 awake but resting state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local
 deviations in the OEF represent the physiological basis of signals of
 changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional MRI during a wide
 variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative metabolic and
 circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography to obtain
 the OEF regionally throughout the brain. Areas of activation were
 conspicuous by their absence. All significant deviations from the mean
 hemisphere OEF were increases, signifying deactivations, and resided
 almost exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of
 an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that
 consistently exhibit decreases from this baseline, during a wide
 variety of goal-directed behaviors monitored with positron-emission
 tomography and functional MRI. These decreases suggest the existence of
 an organized, baseline default mode of brain function that is suspended
 during specific goal-directed behaviors.}}

Despite the ubiquity of these networks, it remains unclear how regions within these large-scale neural networks interact to orchestrate behavior. Here, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 188 human subjects who engaged in three cognitive tasks and a resting-state scan. Using multiple tasks and a large sample allowed us to use split-sample validations to test for replication of results. We parceled the task-rest pairs into functional networks using a probabilistic spatial independent components analysis. We examined changes in connectivity between task and rest states using dual-regression analysis, which quantifies voxelwise connectivity estimates for each network of interest while controlling for the influence of signals arising from other networks and artifacts. Our analyses revealed systematic state-dependent functional connectivity in one brain region: the precuneus. Specifically, task performance led to increased connectivity (compared to rest) between the precuneus and the left frontoparietal network (lFPN), whereas rest increased connectivity between the precuneus and the default-mode network (DMN). The absolute magnitude of this effect was greater for DMN, suggesting a heightened specialization for resting-state cognition. All results replicated within the two independent samples. Our results indicate that the precuneus plays a core role not only in DMN, but also more broadly through its engagement under a variety of processing states.},

abstract = {Our brain is a network. It consists of spatially distributed, but functionally linked regions that continuously share information with each other. Interestingly, recent advances in the acquisition and analysis of functional neuroimaging data have catalyzed the exploration of functional connectivity in the human brain. Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal dependency of neuronal activation patterns of anatomically separated brain regions and in the past years an increasing body of neuroimaging studies has started to explore functional connectivity by measuring the level of co-activation of resting-state fMRI time-series between brain regions. These studies have revealed interesting new findings about the functional connections of specific brain regions and local networks, as well as important new insights in the overall organization of functional communication in the brain network. Here we present an overview of these new methods and discuss how they have led to new insights in core aspects of the human brain, providing an overview of these novel imaging techniques and their implication to neuroscience. We discuss the use of spontaneous resting-state fMRI in determining functional connectivity, discuss suggested origins of these signals, how functional connections tend to be related to structural connections in the brain network and how functional brain communication may form a key role in cognitive performance. Furthermore, we will discuss the upcoming field of examining functional connectivity patterns using graph theory, focusing on the overall organization of the functional brain network. Specifically, we will discuss the value of these new functional connectivity tools in examining believed connectivity diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis.}

    abstract = {Psychedelics are a unique class of drug that commonly produce vivid hallucinations as well as profound psychological and mystical experiences. A grouping of interconnected brain regions characterized by increased temporal coherence at rest have been termed the Default Mode Network (DMN). The DMN has been the focus of numerous studies assessing its role in self-referencing, mind wandering, and autobiographical memories. Altered connectivity in the DMN has been associated with a range of neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. To date, several studies have investigated how psychedelics modulate this network, but no comprehensive review, to our knowledge, has critically evaluated how major classical psychedelic agents—lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and ayahuasca—modulate the DMN. Here we present a systematic review of the knowledge base. Across psychedelics there is consistent acute disruption in resting state connectivity within the DMN and increased functional connectivity between canonical resting-state networks. Various models have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanisms of psychedelics, and in one model DMN modulation is a central axiom. Although the DMN is consistently implicated in psychedelic studies, it is unclear how central the DMN is to the therapeutic potential of classical psychedelic agents. This article aims to provide the field with a comprehensive overview that can propel future research in such a way as to elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms of psychedelics.},

abstract = {This article examines functional and anatomical connectivity in healthy human subjects measured with magnetic resonance imaging methods. Anatomical connectivity in white matter is obtained from measurements of the diffusion tensor. A Monte-Carlo simulation determines the probability that a particle diffuses between two points, with the probability of a jump in a particular direction from a given voxel being based on the local value of the diffusion tensor components. Functional connectivity between grey matter pixels is assessed without recourse to a specific activation paradigm, by calculating the correlation coefficient between random fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal time course in different pixels. The methods are used to examine the anatomical and functional connectivities between crowns of adjacent gyri. A high functional connectivity was found between grey matter pixels, with white matter displaying only very low correlation. A comparison of the measurements of anatomical and functional connectivity found that there is no simple correlation between these measures, except that low values of functional connectivity were not found together with high values of anatomical connectivity. Furthermore pairs of regions situated around the central sulcus indicated a dependence of the two connectivity measures on each other. These results are in accordance with an interpretation that regions which are clearly directly linked by white matter fiber tracts should show high functional connectivity, but that the inverse need not be true as functional connectivity may also be indirectly mediated via more distant grey matter regions.}

abstract = {Abstract Functional connectivity among brain regions has been investigated via an analysis of correlations between regional signal fluctuations recorded in magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in a steady state. In comparison with studies of functional connectivity that utilize task manipulations, the analysis of correlations in steady state data is less susceptible to confounds arising when functionally unrelated brain regions respond in similar ways to changes in task. A new approach to identifying interregional correlations in steady state data makes use of two independent data sets. Regions of interest (ROIs) are defined and hypotheses regarding their connectivity are generated in one data set. The connectivity hypotheses are then evaluated in the remaining (independent) data set by analyzing low frequency temporal correlations between regions. The roles of the two data sets are then reversed and the process repeated, perhaps multiple times. This method was illustrated by application to the language system. The existence of a functional connection between Broca's area and Wernicke's area was confirmed in healthy subjects at rest. An increase in this functional connection when the language system was actively engaged (when subjects were continuously listening to narrative text) was also confirmed. In a second iteration of analyses, a correlation between Broca's area and a region in left premotor cortex was found to be significant at rest and to increase during continuous listening. These findings suggest that the proposed methodology can reveal the presence and strength of functional connections in high-level cognitive systems. Hum.
